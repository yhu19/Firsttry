# Reflection 4

### Geoff West in his book explains scale as a tool to explore multiple aspects that human can be facing. He picks up many controversial concerns and answers them with using of scaling respectively. One of the topics he mentions is how cities and global urbanization play in determining the future of the planet. He lists some challenges that matter about the future human development for everyone to debate, and he sums these challenges up as a conceptual framework. He specifically talks about one of the challenges that most countries have been facing and some will face soon is how fast the countries have been urbanizing from such a low percent early on to such a high rate right now and perhaps over 75 percent by 2050; China is a great example to represent this problem: From 1950, the rate of the urbanization has increased from 10 percent to almost 50 percent by the time. The rapid urbanization will bring people lots of issues as West lists: “global warming, long-term environmental changes, limitations on energy” and so on. However, scale can help us to create a model to predict the future growing number and have corresponding solutions as the result comes out. Beside the fact that many countries have rapid urbanization growth rate, the companies also tend to have a rapid growth rate for the purpose of contributing to the GDP. However, the rapid growth only appears in the beginning, it will eventually stop growing by itself. What scale plays a role in between companies and business is that: it can help to “reflect the challenge of efficiently administering a large and complex organization, dominate innovation and ideas encapsulated in superlinear scaling, ultimately leading to stagnation and to mortality.” Last but not least, scaling can help people to understand better of the city rate as seeing them as a better of one another, for instance: New York might can probably be described as a scaled-up San Francisco. And, that is why scaling can be seen as “an underlying network theory implies that despite external appearance and habitats.” Just as there could be a theoretical organism that fits all the features from all, cities of different sizes can be described in the same way as mentioned before. West's words on big data and theory are deeply reflected in the practical activities of science. On the one hand, from the logic of scientific research development, theories often originate from the precise analysis and objective grasp of scientific data. High-quality data often leads to theories closest to the truth, and data becomes a tool, method, or approach for people to understand the world. On the other hand, the role of theory for data research is often not to be underestimated. Although theory cannot predict the data itself, scientific prediction of the development of the data direction, effectively guide the data analysis and its application. And when it comes to real life, it can be found quite often: a person, no matter what field he is expert in (math/science/literature), he not only needs the knowledge from that field but also need any other required knowledge. Just like an data engineer, only knowing the data part might give you a big frame of what you are doing, but when it comes to the basic lines of work: you might need to apply math or anything else that you need in order to finish those tasks.
