# Reflection 2

### As the technology is improving day by day, people are trying to seek a way to deal with massive amount of data sets, and that’s where the word “Big Data” comes in front of people’s eyesight. We used to have not as much data as we are entering the digital age. At the time, people could still discover such new objects with the old scientific approach. However, the fact now that we are facing such a large amount of data sets, according to Anderson: “this approach to science – hypothesize, model, test – is becoming obsolete.” With Big Data, we can now easily analyze and extract the useful information from that dataset. And this not only applies to a specific field of study because as long as you have something to analyze, there will be relevant information on the Internet.  
  
### As for example of human movement. If we assume whole population of an area as a data frame and the population of each small section as a dataset, then we can predict people’s movement based on the population flow rate for each period. Similar things can apply to human behavior, if you have the information of what certain amount of people do for each period, then you can predict how these people will do next. Relationship is slightly different from the other two because it’s more private so this might be more complicated, but it should still be viable.
  
### Although human development is a complex system, data science is the way to help us solve the hard and complex situations.  If we can use data science to analyze people’s movement, behavior, and relationships, then any related problems would be solved, which includes economic system.
