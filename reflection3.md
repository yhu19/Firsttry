### Owen Barder defines development as a system property of the economic and social system that is not the sum of what happens to people and firms in the economy. In order to further explain the definition from Amartya Sen, Barder makes a comparison of people’s income between South Korea and Ghana which had roughly the same income per person in 1960s but then started to have noticeable difference in late 1970s.

### The Toaster Project is about the efforts that Thomas Thwaites made for his toaster which is an electric toaster entirely from scratch finding the raw materials and turning them into parts. He didn’t fully succeed because the toaster worked only about 5 seconds and then burst into flames. From Thomas Thwaites, we realize that even making something as common and cheap as a toaster requires many different technologies and the economy must be developed and rich enough to provide all these different materials and parts.

### The traditional economic models have not been as successful as expected. The reason is that a number of countries have made great economic progress over the past 50 years, and it is difficult for traditional economic models to explain why these countries have had the economic growth experiences they have.

### Steve Jones is a famous evolutionary biologist. However, at first, he started as a soap powder maker in a factory by mixing chemicals in liquid. Then, he was hired to participate helping design a better nozzle. Because the fluid dynamics were nonlinear, Steve Jones made 10 copies of the existing nozzle, then randomly twisted each of the 10 copies, he tested each of the 10 variants he made, measured which one worked best. He then repeated the same process. After 45 generations, he successfully made the nozzles that no one could have designed. This made people realize that even small improvements can bring such game-changing improvements overall.

### A complex adaptive system is a system that is complex in that it is a dynamic network of interactions, but the behavior of the ensemble may not be predictable according to the behavior of the components. It contains variety subjects, the interaction between one another, and some unpredictable incidents.

### Haile Selassie I was the Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930 to 1974. Ethiopia has been trapped in a poverty trap with a wealthy and powerful elite that benefits from the current economic structure and is thus able to suppress the co-development of more diverse and egalitarian economic and social institutions.

### Because in a complex adaptive system, the level of specific improvements and the evolutionary processes often outperform design and at the level of the whole system, nonlinear dynamics makes engineering solutions nearly impossible. Isomorphic mimicry in complex adaptive system means that an organization pairs up with any weapons, have a better chance to have support institutional development.

### “Resist fatalism” is the idea to accelerate and shape evolution instead of just accepting it. Norman Borlaug, the man who brought about the Green Revolution by intervening in the evolutionary process to develop high-yielding, disease-resistant wheat varieties, used crossbreeding to increase innovation and then actively selected high-yielding varieties.
