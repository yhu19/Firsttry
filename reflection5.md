### With the development of Internet technology, big data has come into being. In terms of scientific research, Big Data is expected to change or reshape the traditional scientific exploration and science and technology innovation model. Big Data brings great challenges to human research data information storage and management on the one hand; on the other hand, it also creates great value and opportunities for data mining and utilization.

### Big data refers to the massive, high growth rate and diverse information assets that require new processing models to have stronger decision-making, insight and process optimization capabilities. It can reflect the productive life of human society, and through the analysis of big data, it can obtain the valuable information needed. The era of big data came with the development of the Internet, which has caused a radical change in human society.

### The transmission and access to information largely determines the speed of business development and has a great impact on people's lives. Big Data has changed the traditional face-to-face way of transmitting information, strengthened the timeliness of transmitting information, improved the limited nature of transmitting information by telephone, people do not need to be limited to time and space to transmit information, through the network technology can realize a large amount of information, a variety of types of information can be quickly transmitted, the transmission of information is convenient and fast. People's access to information is also not limited to books, they can check the information they need from the network, and even break the national boundary restrictions, they can get the latest information going abroad through databases. They can also directly contact with people of different professions through emails, which greatly promotes the development of education, scientific research, enterprises, and other different fields and strengthens the connection and communication between regions.

### The application of big data to social security management has greatly improved the efficiency and effectiveness of management. For example, through statistics and analysis of road passenger flow, vehicles, and traffic jam times, road design can provide a basis for road width and other data, and additional traffic police officers can be assigned to direct and guide during traffic jam times to avoid widespread traffic congestion caused by events such as traffic conflicts.

### The use of big data to divide the health care system is more scientific and can alleviate the current situation of difficult access to doctors. Through statistics and analysis of different types of patients visiting hospitals, the number of medical and nursing staff in each department, the type and number of resuscitation instruments, the number of hospital beds, the type and number of drugs purchased, etc. can be planned rationally to make better use of hospital resources such as money and space. Big data can also be used to analyze the high season and high incidence of certain diseases, for instance influenza, so that effective measures can be taken in advance for prevention, which can greatly reduce the number of illnesses.

### The use of computers, cell phones and other networking has penetrated into every aspect of people's lives, but there are many risk factors in the network, such as Trojan horses or malicious attacks, which can steal people's personal information and cause the collapse of cell phones, computers and other electronic equipment systems, threatening the safety of people's property and even personal safety. According to valid data, more than half of Chinese Internet users' personal identity information has been leaked and nearly half of them have their personal communication information leaked. Chinese Internet users have also lost a lot of personal assets due to spam, fraudulent information and personal information leakage.

### Today's world is the world of economic globalization, the era of knowledge economy, advanced science and technology and innovation capabilities determine the development of enterprises and even countries, the financial industry, e-commerce industry and many other industries have adopted big data to inject new vitality and vigor into the development of enterprises, big data analysis capabilities determine the core competitiveness of enterprises and countries, and whether they can be invincible in the fierce market competition.

### However, the challenges people face in the era of big data are daunting and cannot be ignored. The rapid expansion of Big Data places higher demands on the storage, delivery and utilization of data, and the technologies required for the development and maintenance of data systems are becoming more and more advanced, which places higher demands on professional development-oriented personnel. In addition, accurate analysis and management of big data is a prerequisite for creating effective value, and there is a great demand for talents in data analysis and management. However, the lack of talents in this area greatly limits the development of enterprises, and therefore, the cultivation of talents is imminent. In addition, the damage caused by the leakage of personal information is incalculable, so it is imperative to study the security of big data.
