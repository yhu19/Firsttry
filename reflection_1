In the article “Don’t forget people in the use of big data for development,” the author Joshua Blumenstock wrote about the promise, pitfalls, and ways forward about nowadays data science structure. As he described, the algorithms could calculate one’s credit score based on the person’s information and could help to distinguish the level of poverty for a region so that the governments could give out aid to those who were in need. He also predicted that the algorithms could analyze the effect that a natural disaster or a pandemic could cause. However, the promise is more the ideal thoughts of the data science, there will be downsides because not everything is perfect.  Blumenstock listed 4 terms that he discovered as problems: 1. Unanticipated effects: people who were in need or more vulnerable did not get the benefits that they were expected to receive because the power was only under the control of a few; 2. Lack of validation: the new algorithms were not being tested as many times as the conventional data-collection methods. In facts, it had been “tested in only a handful of countries,” which in turn, could cause the issues in its accuracy that still needed to be verified; 3. Biased algorithms: this is kind of similar to unanticipated effects, the most disadvantaged people were not really being benefited from the big data because of its inaccuracy; 4. Lack of regulation: the conventional development data were usually in the hands of the private companies, which would not be an issue for the US and Europe because there were legislation to regulate them; however, such system that appeared in the US and Europe barely existed in developing countries.
